# Hazel Game Engine

Made following The Cherno [Game Engine series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT)

Disclaimer: most of this code is from [TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno), including the Readme.md

## Getting started
Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 is recommended, Hazel is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/AleksaHeler/Hazel`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

## The plan
The plan for Hazel is two-fold: to create a powerful 3D engine, but also to serve as an education tool for teaching game engine design and architecture. 

### Main features to come:
- Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
- High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering (this will be expanded later, 2D to come first)
- Support for Mac, Linux, Android and iOS
    - Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal)
- Fully featured viewer and editor applications
- Fully scripted interaction and behavior
- Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine
- Procedural terrain and world generation
- Artificial Intelligence
- Audio system
